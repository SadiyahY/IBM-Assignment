    "*Anyone involved in data science knows that the industry is* *fast becoming one of the most exciting careers of the 21st* *entury. In some ways, being a data scientist is like a* *modern-day Sherlock Holmes working as a detective. Anyone* *who is curious and loves everyday puzzles can thrive in* *this industry. You can play with your knowledge when* *working with data. You can also use it to run* *domain_oriented experiments.I believe data science is the* *future of data. This is the only way to efficiently and* *reproducibly achieve excellent results. More tools and* *flexibility to collect and use multiple databases at the* *same time would also be very useful. DS is the future and* *it's better to be up to date than left behind. DS is a* *rapidly evolving field, so at least most of a data* *scientist's job is to update the methods, tools, and* *workflows I envision. Reading DS may seem tempting, but* *working in this field is even more exciting. This is the* *best way to start your trip to the region.*\n",
